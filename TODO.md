# TODO: Fix AddSong.jsx File Upload Issue

- [x] Fix FormData constructor capitalization in onSubmitHandler
- [x] Add useEffect to fetch albums from backend and populate album select
- [x] Improve error handling in onSubmitHandler (log errors, specific toast messages)
- [x] Optionally improve song file preview UI (skipped, not critical)
- [x] Fix multer fileFilter to allow audio files
- [ ] Test the fix by restarting backend and attempting to add a song
